# Step 1: Naming a variable and setting its initial value to integer 8.
first_number = 8

# Step 2: Naming a variable and setting its initial value to  integer 10.
second_number = 10

# Step 3: NAming  a third variable that stores the sum of the first two numbers
sum_result = first_number + second_number

# Step 4: Printing the value of the sum to the console
print( "sum of", first_number, "and", second_number, "is:", sum_result)
